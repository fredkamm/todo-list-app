# Todo-List-App

This is a simple todo list used to keep track of things that i need to accomplish. This todo list has the ability to edit and delete items on the list. And it also crosses of the item on the list when i finish doing that objective.


# Inspiration

I wanted to improve on my local storage skills and the best project to practice with using local storage is creating a todo list app that will remember information that a user typed in from previous sessions.
